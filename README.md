# FOOTSTEPS OF RAMA

Welcome, presenting to you our Mini-Project.

## Project info
Our Mini-project "The Footsteps of Rama: From Ayodhya to Sri Lanka” is a digital initiative aimed at creating a modern cultural tourism platform presenting the timeless epic ‘The Ramayana’, which is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India and an important text of Hinduism. Our website represents a pioneering effort to leverage digital technology and creative storytelling to reconnect today's youth with the profound cultural heritage of India embodied in the Ramayana narrative. 
The Ramayana, has deeply shaped the cultural, moral, and spiritual fabric of the Indian subcontinent for centuries. Its narratives, characters, and values continue to inspire not only religious devotion but also literature, art, music, and performance traditions across diverse regions and languages. Today, with renewed interest in exploring India’s cultural roots and historical geography, there is a growing demand for accessible, engaging platforms that combine education and travel.

**Problem Statement:**
Despite The Ramayana’s enduring significance, available resources in the current digital ecosystem surrounding the epic are fragmented across disparate platforms: some focus on scripture and scholarly interpretation, others on travel blogs or cultural references, and few provide immersive or interactive experiences. Most lack regional language support, contextual storytelling, or real-world travel integration.
This fragmented ecosystem creates significant barriers for modern users—especially students, educators, and culturally curious travelers—who seek a meaningful, holistic engagement with the epic. There is no single platform that connects the literary richness of the Ramayana with the geographical journey of Lord Rama in a way that is educational, interactive, and actionable.
